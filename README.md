# python-api-challenge

This was a 2-part assignment. In the first part, I pulled weather data for over 500 cities to analyze certain weather components as it relates to the equator and the further out we move away from it. The four main measurements I looked at were: Max Temperatures, Humidity, Windiness and Cloudiness. With this information, I created visuals to understand the relationship and ultimately produced a CSV file that lists cities to further analyze in part 2.

In the second part, I utilized the csv output created in Part 1 to condense my list of cities down to just a few based on the three parameters I've chosen. I then found hotels within those areas that meet my ideal conditions.
